# Program purpose:
The program aims to classify vectors using multithreading, enhancing classification performance. It is useful for individuals involved in data analysis or machine learning who want to leverage multithreading for faster classification of large datasets.
# Use of threads:
The program employs threads for parallel vector classification, improving overall performance by leveraging multicore processors.
# Functionality:
The program can read vector data from CSV files, allowing users to provide their datasets for classification.

It utilizes the Euclidean distance metric to classify test vectors based on the nearest neighbors in the training set.
The classification process involves computing the Euclidean distance between each test vector and all training vectors to determine the closest match.

After classification, the program displays the classification results, including the number of correctly classified vectors and the overall accuracy.
Users can visualize the performance of the classification algorithm and assess its effectiveness.
